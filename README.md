# Inspect-Mo

> **Secure, type-safe validation and authorization for every Motoko canister.**

---

## üöÄ Overview

Inspect-Mo is a comprehensive validation and authorization framework for Motoko canisters on the Internet Computer. It enables developers to declaratively secure canister methods using a dual-pattern system (inspect/guard), with type-safe rules, minimal boilerplate, and production-grade features.

**Key Features:**
- Type-safe validation for all canister method arguments
- Dual-pattern: boundary (inspect) and runtime (guard) validation
- Authentication, authorization, and rate limiting out of the box
- Code generation tool for automatic type-safe accessors and validation helpers
- Production-ready: fully tested, with real-world examples and benchmarks

## üß≠ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   mops install
   ```
2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   dfx build
   ```
3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   mops test
   # or for integration tests
   npm test
   ```
4. **Explore examples:**
   - See [`examples/user-management.mo`](examples/user-management.mo) for a full InspectMo integration pattern
   - Browse the `examples/` and `canisters/` folders for more

## üîß Code generation (CLI)

Use the InspectMo Codegen CLI to generate boilerplate from your Candid (.did) files. Re-run after any interface changes.

Install options:
- One-off (no install):
   ```bash
   npx @icdevs-org/inspectmo@latest --help
   ```
- Global install (optional):
   ```bash
   npm i -g @icdevs-org/inspectmo
   inspectmo --help
   ```

Common commands:
- Generate from a specific .did file:
   ```bash
   inspectmo generate path/to/service.did -o src/generated/service-inspect.mo
   ```
- Discover .did files and generate into `src/generated/`:
   ```bash
   inspectmo discover . --generate --output src/generated/
   ```
- Analyze (no code output):
   ```bash
   inspectmo analyze path/to/service.did
   ```
- DFX build hooks (DFX only):
   ```bash
   inspectmo install-hooks . --output src/generated/
   inspectmo status .
   ```

Notes:
- `mops.toml` does not support prebuild hooks; only DFX integration is supported.
- Generated Motoko modules are not committed; re-run codegen after pulling changes that affect interfaces.

## Limitations in v0.1.0

- Rate limiting is stubbed and not functional. The intended design places update-call checks in `canister_inspect_message` and query checks in guards; see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for details. This will land in a future release.
- RBAC is example-only and not a built-in framework. Examples demonstrate patterns; production apps should implement their own roles/permissions.
Notes:
- `dfx` does not support a root-level `scripts` field or a per-canister `prebuild` hook in `dfx.json`. We intentionally run codegen manually instead of wiring it into `dfx.json`.
- The generated Motoko modules are ignored from version control; re-run codegen after pulling changes that affect interfaces.

## üõ°Ô∏è Core Concepts

### Dual-Pattern Validation
- **Inspect Pattern:** Secure boundary validation at the `system inspect` level (protects from first call)
- **Guard Pattern:** Runtime validation with full call context (typed arguments, caller, cycles, etc.)

### ErasedValidator Architecture
- Type erasure solved via function generator pattern
- All validation logic "baked in" at registration for type safety and performance

### Security Philosophy
- Trust the IC for authentication (`msg.caller`)
- Focus on business logic authorization and role-based access
- See [`docs/AUTHENTICATION_PHILOSOPHY.md`](docs/AUTHENTICATION_PHILOSOPHY.md)

### Code Generation Tool
- Auto-generates type-safe accessors and validation helpers from .did files
- See [`tools/codegen/`](tools/codegen/) and [`docs/PROJECT.md`](docs/PROJECT.md)

---

## üß™ Testing & Quality

- **Motoko unit tests:** in `test/` (run with `mops test`)
- **Integration tests:** in `pic/` (run with `npm test`)
- **Performance benchmarks:** in `bench/`
- See [`docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`](docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for details

### Note on orthogonal upgrades (PIC.js)
- Until PIC.js exposes a first-class orthogonal upgrade API, tests use a local helper to call `install_code` with `mode = upgrade`, `wasm_memory_persistence = keep`, and `skip_pre_upgrade = None`. Track progress here: https://github.com/dfinity/pic-js/issues/146. If unavailable, simulate upgrade cadence via stop/start and validate weekly timers post-restart.

**Inspect-Mo: Secure, type-safe validation for every Motoko canister.**

## OVS Default Behavior

This motoko class has a default OVS behavior that sends cycles to the developer to provide funding for maintenance and continued development. In accordance with the OVS specification and ICRC85, this behavior may be overridden by another OVS sharing heuristic or turned off. We encourage all users to implement some form of OVS sharing as it helps us provide quality software and support to the community.

Default behavior: 1 XDR per month for up to 10,000 actions; 0.2 additional XDR per month for each additional 10,000 guards. Max of 10 XDR per month per canister.

Default Beneficiary: ICDevs.org
