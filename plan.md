## Quick Start

For immediate implementation guidance:
1. Start with **[PROJECT.md](docs/PROJECT.md)** for project overview
2. Review **[API.md](docs/API.md)** for usage patterns  
3. Check **[EXAMPLES.md](docs/EXAMPLES.md)** for real-world implementations
4. Follow **[WORKPLAN.md](docs/WORKPLAN.md)** for development progress
5. Reference **[ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** for technical details

## Key Concepts

**Dual Pattern Architecture**: The library uses both boundary validation (inspect) and runtime validation (guard) for comprehensive security.

**User-Defined Accessors**: Simple functions extract fields from method arguments, solving Motoko's type inspection limitations.

**Typed Context**: Runtime validation receives full call context with typed arguments, caller information, and execution details.
